Shallow search within predefined directories.  Useful for situations where a normal Windows Explorer search is prohibitely slow, such as finding commonly accessed folder locations or searching across networked drives.  

Build using `electron-packager .`, or find the latest version under [releases](/timmythetiny/fuzz_electron/releases).
